# letterboxd-client

This is an unofficial letterboxd API client. I am unable to provide you with credentials to their API. If you already have credentials, this may help.

Check out the tests for example API calls.

`npm build` will compile everything you need. make sure to build before you run `npm publish`. If `tsc` fails, install typescript globally with `npm install -g typescript`

`npm test` will run unit tests
